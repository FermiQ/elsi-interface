# Overview

The `elsi_inverse_slate.f90` file provides low-level Fortran wrapper subroutines for performing Hermitian matrix inversion using the SLATE (Software for Linear Algebra Targeting Exascale) library. SLATE is designed for high-performance distributed linear algebra operations, potentially utilizing GPU acceleration. These wrappers specifically implement matrix inversion via a Cholesky factorization followed by the computation of the inverse using these factors ($A \rightarrow L L^H \rightarrow A^{-1} = (L L^H)^{-1}$). The routines are tailored for matrices distributed in the ScaLAPACK block-cyclic format and are available for both double precision complex (`complex*16`) and single precision complex (`complex*8`) data types.

# Key Components

This file does not define a Fortran module but contains two public subroutines that serve as direct interfaces to SLATE functionalities:

- **`elsi_inverse_slate_c64(n, n_bb_row, n_bb_col, A, lda, nb, p, q, mpi_comm_)`**:
  This subroutine inverts a double precision complex (COMPLEX(16)) Hermitian matrix `A` distributed in ScaLAPACK format.
  The process involves:
  1.  Creating a SLATE Hermitian matrix representation (`slate_A`) from the input ScaLAPACK matrix `A` (assuming the upper triangular part 'U' is provided) using `slate_HermitianMatrix_create_fromScaLAPACK_c64`.
  2.  Computing the Cholesky factorization of `slate_A` (in place) using `slate_chol_factor_c64`.
  3.  Calculating the inverse of the original matrix `A` using the computed Cholesky factors via `slate_chol_inverse_using_factor_c64`. The result overwrites the input matrix `A`.
  4.  Releasing the SLATE matrix object using `slate_HermitianMatrix_destroy_c64`.

- **`elsi_inverse_slate_c32(n, n_bb_row, n_bb_col, A, lda, nb, p, q, mpi_comm_)`**:
  This subroutine performs the same matrix inversion process as `elsi_inverse_slate_c64` but operates on single precision complex (COMPLEX(8)) Hermitian matrices. It uses the corresponding `_c32` versions of the SLATE library routines.

# Important Variables/Constants

The subroutines take the following parameters, which describe the distributed matrix and the parallel environment:

- **`n` (integer, kind `c_int64_t`)**: The global dimension of the square input matrix `A`.
- **`n_bb_row` (integer, kind `c_int64_t`)**: The number of rows in the local portion of matrix `A` on the calling MPI process. This is the local leading dimension for the ScaLAPACK layout.
- **`n_bb_col` (integer, kind `c_int64_t`)**: The number of columns in the local portion of matrix `A` on the calling MPI process.
- **`A` (complex*16 or complex*8, intent `INOUT`)**: The distributed input matrix. It is expected to be Hermitian and stored in ScaLAPACK block-cyclic format. On successful completion, `A` is overwritten with its inverse.
- **`lda` (integer, kind `c_int64_t`)**: The leading dimension of the local array `A` as declared in the calling program (should be $\ge n\_bb\_row$).
- **`nb` (integer, kind `c_int64_t`)**: The block size used in the ScaLAPACK block-cyclic distribution of matrix `A`.
- **`p` (integer, kind `c_int`)**: The number of processor rows in the 2D BLACS process grid over which matrix `A` is distributed.
- **`q` (integer, kind `c_int`)**: The number of processor columns in the 2D BLACS process grid.
- **`mpi_comm_` (integer, kind `c_int`)**: The MPI communicator associated with the BLACS process grid.
- **`slate_A` (internal, type `c_ptr`)**: A C pointer that holds the reference to SLATE's internal representation of the distributed matrix.
- **`opts` (internal, type `c_ptr`)**: A C pointer for passing options to SLATE routines. In these wrappers, it is passed as `0`, indicating default behavior or null options.

# Usage Examples

These subroutines are intended to be called by higher-level routines within the ELSI library when matrix inversion using SLATE is required. For example, they might be used to compute the inverse of an overlap matrix $S^{-1}$.

Conceptual Fortran usage (assuming these routines are linked directly or part of an accessible module):
```fortran
! Assume:
!   global_matrix_size, local_rows, local_cols,
!   leading_dim_A, block_size_nb, proc_rows_p, proc_cols_q,
!   active_mpi_comm are all appropriately defined.
!   my_dist_matrix_c64 is a 2D COMPLEX*16 array containing the local part
!   of the matrix to be inverted.

! To invert a double precision complex matrix:
call elsi_inverse_slate_c64( &
    n=global_matrix_size, &
    n_bb_row=local_rows, n_bb_col=local_cols, &
    A=my_dist_matrix_c64, lda=leading_dim_A, &
    nb=block_size_nb, p=proc_rows_p, q=proc_cols_q, &
    mpi_comm_=active_mpi_comm )

! After the call, my_dist_matrix_c64 contains the inverse.
```

# Dependencies and Interactions

- **`iso_c_binding`**: This intrinsic Fortran module is essential for interoperability with the SLATE library, which is typically implemented in C++. It provides C-compatible data types (`c_int64_t`, `c_int`, `c_ptr`) and allows Fortran to call C functions.
- **SLATE Library (`slate` module)**: These wrappers are direct callers to the SLATE library. The specific SLATE routines used are:
  - `slate_HermitianMatrix_create_fromScaLAPACK_c64` (and `_c32`)
  - `slate_chol_factor_c64` (and `_c32`)
  - `slate_chol_inverse_using_factor_c64` (and `_c32`)
  - `slate_HermitianMatrix_destroy_c64` (and `_c32`)
  A functioning SLATE installation linked with ELSI is necessary for these routines to work.
- **MPI (Message Passing Interface)**: An MPI communicator is required by SLATE to manage its distributed computations. The calling environment must be MPI-parallel.
- **ScaLAPACK**: The input matrix `A` must be distributed according to the ScaLAPACK block-cyclic scheme, as SLATE uses this information to correctly interpret the distributed data.
- **Calling ELSI Routines**: These low-level wrappers are likely not called directly by end-users but by other ELSI modules that manage different strategies for matrix operations. For instance, an ELSI routine for computing $S^{-1}$ might select these SLATE wrappers if SLATE is specified as the preferred backend for such operations.
